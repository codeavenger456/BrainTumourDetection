# Report 2

Right now, my CNN model performs around 80% accuracy to correctly predict the output (true positive and true negative)

However, it has a 13% ~ 15% false positive rate which can be a bit problematic.

I used False Positive metric to measure the performance of the model, but it gives a worse result, so I will stick with accuracy metric.

I used RMSprop optimizer in my model, while training, validation training always has a major drop,
  so I change it to adam optimizer, it is more stable and performs slightly better than the previous optimizer.

Since the model is overfitting, I add BatchNormalization layers to my VGG architecture also reduce epochs to 4 to avoid further learning.

I will probably use Django to deploy my website and to interact with users since I have some experience with Django.

If time allows, I can add some features about giving information of a closest hospital near the users given the location or some elite hospital research centers.
